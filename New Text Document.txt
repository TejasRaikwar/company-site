Great! Let's extract the contents of the `src.zip` file and then analyze the code to estimate the cost.

I'll start by extracting the ZIP file.

The extracted files indicate a web development project primarily using JavaScript, JSX (React), and CSS. Here's a brief breakdown of the project structure:

1. **Main Application Files:**
   - `App.js`, `index.js`: Core React application files.
   - CSS files for styling.

2. **Assets:**
   - Images and other static assets used in the project.

3. **Components:**
   - Reusable React components like `Footer`, `Navbar`, `HeroSlider`, etc.
   - Each component typically has a corresponding CSS file for styling.

4. **Pages:**
   - Different pages of the application, e.g., `Homepage`, `AboutUs`, `ServicesContent`, etc.

5. **Routing:**
   - `routes.js`: Defines the routing for the application.

### Estimating the Cost

To estimate the cost, we'll consider the following:

1. **Code Complexity and Development Effort:**
   - Number of components and pages.
   - Integration of assets.
   - Overall structure and functionality.

2. **Developer Rates:**
   - Rates can vary based on the developer's location and expertise. For this estimation, we'll consider an average rate.

### Steps for Estimation

1. **Assess the Number of Components and Pages:**
   - Count the number of unique components and pages.
   - Estimate the complexity of each (simple, moderate, complex).

2. **Estimate Development Hours:**
   - Simple component/page: 4-8 hours.
   - Moderate component/page: 8-16 hours.
   - Complex component/page: 16-32 hours.

3. **Average Hourly Rate:**
   - Junior developer: $30/hour.
   - Mid-level developer: $50/hour.
   - Senior developer: $80/hour.

#### Let's break down the components and pages:

- **Components:**
  - Footer
  - HeroSlider
  - Navbar (with sub-components like AboutUs, Industries, Services, Technologies)
  - OurClients
  - OurServices
  - etc.

- **Pages:**
  - Layout
  - AboutUs
  - Blog
  - CaseStudy
  - Homepage
  - IndustriesContent
  - NoPage
  - Portfolio
  - ServicesContent
  - TechnologiesContent

#### Estimation Example

Assuming:
- 10 simple components (average 6 hours each)
- 5 moderate components (average 12 hours each)
- 5 pages (average 20 hours each)

### Calculation

1. **Components:**
   - Simple: 10 components * 6 hours = 60 hours
   - Moderate: 5 components * 12 hours = 60 hours

2. **Pages:**
   - Pages: 5 pages * 20 hours = 100 hours

Total Development Hours: 60 + 60 + 100 = 220 hours

### Cost Estimate

Using an average developer rate of $50/hour:

Total Cost: 220 hours * $50/hour = $11,000

This is a rough estimate and actual costs can vary based on specific requirements, additional features, and developer rates.
